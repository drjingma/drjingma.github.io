# Abstract

**Introduction**: Canine cognitive dysfunction is a valuable model for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (ADRD) due to condensed lifespan, naturally occurring clinical signs, genetic diversity, shared environment with humans, and similar molecular and neuropathological hallmarks.

**Methods**: The objective of the Brain Health Study was to build infrastructure to support a diverse national cohort of companion dogs for in-depth, longitudinal analysis of brain and cognitive health over their lifespan. A complex and well-maintained research platform was critical to facilitate enrollment, retention, and biobanking of biofluids and postmortem tissue.

**Results**: The research infrastructure is in place for longitudinal data collection, annual biospecimen collection and postmortem sample collection. The team has conducted 21 postmortem exams.

**Discussion**: Although most of the 500 enrolled subjects remain alive, biomarker identification, neuropathology, and proteomics analysis is underway. Future outcomes will benefit the worldwide research community through an Open Data sharing platform.

**Highlights**: The dog serves as a novel translational large animal model for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and ad and related dementias. A large research platform supports collection of biofluids and post mortem tissue. The companion dog has key molecular and neuropathological hallmarks of AD. The Brain Health Study research platform has successfully enrolled 500 dogs across the United States. Post mortem biofluid and tissue has been donated from 21 enrolled dogs.
