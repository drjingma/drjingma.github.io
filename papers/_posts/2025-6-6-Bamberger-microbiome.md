# Abstract

Companion dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) offer a unique model for studying the gut microbiome and its relation to aging due to their cohabitation with humans, sharing similar environments, diets, and healthcare practices. Here, we present the Dog Aging Project (DAP) Precision cohort, the largest population-wide study of the canine gut microbiome to date. This cohort encompasses over 900 dogs of diverse breeds, environments, and demographics living across the United States. Coupling fecal shotgun metagenomic sequencing with comprehensive phenotypic and environmental surveys and clinical lab tests, we explore the intricate relationships between microbiome composition, aging, and key factors such as diet, health, and living conditions. Our analyses identify various factors associated with microbiome composition. In addition, we find a gradual shift in microbiome composition with age, which allows us to develop a novel metagenomics-based “clock” to predict biological aging based on microbial signatures. Overall, these findings provide an unprecedented and detailed understanding of the role the gut microbiome plays in our four-legged companions, offering both potential applications in veterinary medicine and an exciting model for aging research.
