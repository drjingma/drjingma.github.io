I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://www.fhcrc.org/) affiliated with the [Public Health Sciences Division](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/public-health-sciences-division.html). I am also an Affiliate faculty in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/faculty) at the University of Washington. 

I am originally from [Shangqiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shangqiu), an ancient city in central China. I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) and my Ph.D. in Statistics from [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) where I worked under the supervision of Dr. [George Michailidis](https://informatics.research.ufl.edu/homepage/about-us/michailidis.html). During graduate school, I became interested in high-dimensional data analysis and network biology. This led to a postdoctoral training with Dr. [Hongzhe Li](http://statgene.med.upenn.edu/) and Dr. [Tony Cai](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~tcai/) at the University of Pennsylvania.
